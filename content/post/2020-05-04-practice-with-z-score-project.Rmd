Background:
The Altman Z Score is


Questions:
[1] How does the Altman Z-Score work?
[2] How much should we remove from the dataset?
[3] Why are these values so skewed? How do we differentiate between values that are skewed+important vs those that just create noise? 




Exploration:


We can see that the data is skewed heavily towards the negative so removing this data is necessary to effecitvely see how the z-score is changing.[2] [3]
```{r zscore}
plotthis <- ZScoreYearsSummaryV3 %>% 
  mutate(Year = substr(ZScoreYearsSummaryV3$DATADATE,1,4)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Avg_ZScore))

plot(plotthis)

```

Once removing this information we find the following changes: 

```{r zscore}

ZscoreGroupedbyFY <- DataZscore %>% 
  group_by(FYEAR) %>% 
  summarise(Zscore=mean(Zscore))

ggplot(ZscoreGroupedbyFY, aes(x = FYEAR, y = Zscore))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle('Avg Zscore by Year')


```
